#gather functionalities implemented or not, discussed in the forums that a Vaadin navigation system should have.


= Namings =

The preferred and most natural word for a class representing a page is "Page".

"Application" should be used in its "Web Application" meaning (one instance per ServletContext). It should not mean "HttpSession" as it do in Vaadin v6.

"Window" is perfect for floating windows and modal dialog boxes. It could be used for meaning "meta container of a page in a browser tab". It should be named SomethingWindow, not just Window then. It should have a special class or interface more specific than just "Window". For example "AppLevelWindow".


= Annotation and xml configuration. =

The annotation way seems to be the preferred way.
Some people would prefer an xml alternative (some kind of struts-config.xml) to have "a clear sitemap in one file". Maybe an alternative possible configuration way.

= Hidden Pages =

It should be possible to configure some pages, so they don't change the URI.
I would typically error pages. It would be also the pages of a wizard (the URI would not change (optionnal) between the pages of a wizard).

The typical way to access these pages would be a forward. Maybe it's the forward method that should take a "keepPreviousUri" boolean parameter, the pages would have nothing special.
