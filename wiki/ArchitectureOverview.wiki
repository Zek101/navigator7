#summary Architecture Overview

Navigator7 is inspired by building BlackBeltFactory.com with Vaadin 6.
We have implemented many replies from forum posts over the months in our application.

One day, we have extracted and reengineered that infrastructure code out of our application to create Navigator7.

The architecture of Navigator7 is also inspired by the Navigator add-on from Joonas.
